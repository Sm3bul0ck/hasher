# hasher

hasher is a program that will be able compute a number of different hashes while only reading a file once. A buffer is
read and then threads are spawned for each selected hash, resulting in huge speed gains over hashing sequentially.

Currently this will spit out a bunch of JSON files at the designated directory, however this will change soon.

## Building

hasher requires a fairly modern version of Rust, preferably the latest. Install it using the instructions located
[here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the latest stable release.

To build, run the following at the root of the repository:

```
cargo build -r
```

After this is complete your binary will be located at `target/release/hasher` and can be moved wherever you desire (or
not, I'm not your dad).

## Usage

### General

```
$ ./hasher --help
A parallel file hashing program.

Usage: hasher [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -i, --input-path <INPUT_PATH>
          The path to be hashed [default: .]
  -v, --verbose...
          More output per occurrence
  -q, --quiet...
          Less output per occurrence
  -j, --json-output-path <JSON_OUTPUT_PATH>
          The path to output hashes, {path}/{sha256}.json [default: ./hashes]
  -c, --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>
          The location of the config file [default: ./config.toml]
      --max-depth <MAX_DEPTH>
          Maximum number of subdirectories to descend when recursing directories [default: 16]
      --no-follow-symlinks
          DON'T follow symlinks
      --breadth-first
          Hash directories breadth first instead of depth first
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

### Config File

In the root of the repository there is a file named `config.toml.template`. This file should be copied to `config.toml`
and the values within should be modified to suit your needs. Altering anything but the values in this template may cause
unintended consequences.

## TODO

- Add outputting hashes to SQL database (instead of JSON files).
  - --json-out and --sql-out args
- Optimize hashing, mainly in evening out file IO by reading another buffer while hashing (helps on spinning rust).
- Add stdin for hashing (treated as 1 file)
  - --input-path becomes the path that will be sent to the DB
- Add option to skip number of files before resuming hashing (--skip-files <NUMBER>)

## Hashes

### Implemented

- CRC32
- MD2
- MD4
- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-2
  - SHA-224 through SHA-512
- SHA-3
  - SHA3-224 through SHA3-512
- BLAKE2
  - Blake2s256, Blake2b512
- BelT
- Whirpool
- Tiger
- Streebog (GOST R 34.11-2012)
- RIPEMD
- FSB
- SM3
- GOST R 34.11-94
- GrÃ¸stl (Groestl)
- SHABAL

### Skipped

The following hashes were not implemented

- SHA-3
  - SHAKE128/SHAKE256
    - They are XOF, need special handling
- BLAKE3
  - XOF
- KangarooTwelve
  - XOF
- Other CRC variants (these don't implement digest so they aren't easily integrated)
  - Adler CRC32 (aka Adler32)
    - In most cases this should be the same as CRC32, however it has the possibility of being different.
  - CRC16
  - CRC64
  - CRC128
